This page lists the requirements to follow the hands-on coding during the tutorial. As the ZigZag project is written in pure Python, setup is rather simple.

## Prerequisites

1. `python >= 3.8`
2. Anaconda, or a similar package manager. A `requirements.txt` file is provided to install the dependencies.
3. An IDE. A launch.json config file will be provided for VS Code users.
